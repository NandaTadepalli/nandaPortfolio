      <h1>Hello I am <br> Tadepalli Nanda</h1>
      <p>Hey on this website I will give an introduction about me! <br>🧑‍💻 As a forward-thinking 2nd-year student at
        KL University pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I am deeply passionate about the
        convergence of technology and innovation. 💡 With a stellar 9.62 CGPA in my first year, I've proven my
        dedication to academic excellence.

        🌐 My journey in tech has led me to explore diverse programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, and
        CSS, while actively participating in hackathons. 🤖 I thrive on challenges and stay updated with the latest
        trends in mobile technologies.

        🌆 Looking forward, I am committed to continuous learning, excited to contribute to groundbreaking projects and
        connect with like-minded professionals who share my enthusiasm for the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let's shape
        the future together!

        🧑‍💻 I have some basic projects like the Tic Tac Too game and some other games in Python which you can see on
        my GitHub</p>
